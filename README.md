# WEB102 Prework - SeaMonster Game Showcase

Submitted by: Khalil McFarlane

SeaMonster Game Showcase is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 17 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [x] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [x] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [x] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
[x] Created a nav bar at the top of the page so that users can get to the Home, Stats and Our Game section quickly.
[x] Updated CSS of the site to make it more visually appealing.


 [ ] In order to improve the functionality of the app I want to allow the users to be able to click a specific game to display more information about it.

## Notes

A challenge I encountered while building the app is formatting my navigation bar. I made a small mistake while making the navigation bar so the spacing didn't turn how I wanted it to look. It also overlapped the content of the page so I had to figure out how to correct both of these.

A second challenge that I encountered was displaying all of the games correctly. The code needed to complete the task of displaying the games was new to me so I had to do a lot of research to make sure that I understood and could complete this step.
